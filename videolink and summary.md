âœ… Project Summary
I finished my cloud-based web hosting project through the use of Amazon EC2 together with Amazon Linux. 
Through the project I established a website connection between GitHub repository files and deployed it on an EC2 instance. 
The project execution was successful despite my attempt to link my EC2 public IP with a GoDaddy domain where DNS technical limitations arose.

I created and included:

A functional website hosted on EC2
A full project documentation covering DNS, SSL/TLS, server setup, script functionality, and usefulness
The project 35617074_meets_project under its name has a detailed README.md documentation file.
The clear explanation of steps will be shown through a presentation.
A final demonstration video represents all work I accomplished in addition to illustrating my acquired knowledge
By completing this project I acquired various new competencies :

My responsibility was to establish and operate cloud servers with Amazon EC2 technology.
Deploying code using GitHub
A basic understanding of DNS configuration together with domain associating system
Basic SSL/TLS security concepts
Real-world cloud infrastructure setup
Through this project I learned valuable skills for cloud computing applications in actual business situations and achieved better web deployment skills and cloud service proficiency.
